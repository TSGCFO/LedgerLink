# Development Security Rule

- During the development phase, do not implement any security protocols, logins, or authorizations.
- Ensure that all security measures, including but not limited to authentication, authorization, encryption, and access controls, are only enabled in production environments.
- Avoid using any security libraries or frameworks in the development environment.
- Do not include any code that enforces user authentication or authorization checks.
- Ensure that all security-related configurations are disabled or bypassed during development.
- Use mock data and test accounts without any security restrictions for development and testing purposes.
- Regularly review the codebase to ensure that no security measures are inadvertently introduced during development.
- Document any security measures that will be implemented in the production environment, but do not apply them in the development environment.
