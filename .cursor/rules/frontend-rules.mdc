## Frontend Development Guidelines

1. Component Organization
   - All frontend components must be placed in the frontend folder
   - Follow a consistent component structure:
     - One component per file
     - Use meaningful component names
     - Group related components in subdirectories

2. UI Framework Requirements
   - Use Material UI as the primary component library
   - Material React Table must be used for all list views
   - Exception: Rules app may use alternative Material UI components or other design libraries

3. Component Implementation
   - List views must display all model fields in table format
   - Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent styling across components
   - Handle loading, error, and empty states appropriately

4. Development Process
   - Analyze model relationships thoroughly before creating components
   - Test components in development server environment
   - Verify component behavior across different screen sizes
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
