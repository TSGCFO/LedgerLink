# Part 1: Introduction to Testing in LedgerLink

This guide introduces the testing approach for the LedgerLink project.

## Why Testing Matters for LedgerLink

LedgerLink is a business-critical application for managing customer orders, product data, and billing calculations. Proper testing ensures:

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring billing calculations are accurate and financial data is consistent
2. **Reliability**: Preventing regressions that could impact daily operations
3. **Maintainability**: Making it easier to refactor and extend the codebase
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how the system should behave

## Testing Architecture

LedgerLink uses a comprehensive testing approach covering multiple layers:

### 1. Unit Tests

- Test individual components in isolation
- Examples: Testing a single model method, utility function, or React component
- Focus on specific behavior and edge cases
- Fast execution for immediate feedback

### 2. Integration Tests 

- Test interactions between components
- Examples: Testing how models interact with each other, API endpoints with database
- Verify that components work together correctly

### 3. API Contract Tests

- Ensure frontend and backend agree on API structure
- Use Pact for consumer-driven contract testing
- Verify both consumer (frontend) and provider (backend) implementations
- Examples: API contract tests for Orders, Customers, Products, Rules and Billing APIs

### 4. End-to-End Tests

- Test complete user flows from UI to database
- Examples: Creating an order, adding a product, generating billing reports
- Verify the application works as a whole

## Testing Tools

### Backend (Django)

- **unittest/pytest**: For unit and integration testing
- **Django Test Client**: For testing views and API endpoints
- **Factory Boy**: For creating test fixtures
- **coverage.py**: For measuring test coverage

### Frontend (React)

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Mock Service Worker**: For mocking API calls
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing

### Contract Testing

- **Pact**: For consumer-driven contract testing
- **Pact Broker**: For sharing contracts between teams

## Current Testing Status

As of March 2025, LedgerLink has:

- Comprehensive unit test coverage for core models and business logic
- API contract tests for all major endpoints
- Frontend component tests for critical components
- Integration tests for complex business logic like rule evaluation and billing

## Getting Started with Testing

To run the existing tests:

```bash
# Backend tests
python manage.py test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test

# Contract tests
cd frontend
npm run test:pact
```

## Best Practices for LedgerLink Testing

1. **Write Tests for New Features**: Any new feature should include tests
2. **Write Tests for Bug Fixes**: Prevent regressions by adding tests for bug fixes
3. **Follow AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert for clear test structure
4. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Names should describe what is being tested
5. **Keep Tests Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other
6. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for APIs, databases when appropriate
7. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure boundary conditions and error cases are tested
8. **Run Tests Before Committing**: Prevent introducing bugs
