### Current Passing Rate
- 22 passing tests out of 66 total tests
- 33% pass rate

## 2. Key Issues Identified

### Database Integration Issues
1. **PostgreSQL Materialized Views**: 
   - Tests for materialized views expect a PostgreSQL database with specific views
   - These views may not exist in the test database
   - Solution: Implement setup fixtures that create test views

2. **Transaction ID Format**:
   - Potential mismatch between transaction ID format expected by tests and actual format
   - Solution: Standardize transaction ID format in factories

3. **Customer Factory Issues**:
   - String length validation failures in Customer model
   - Solution: Implement length constraints in CustomerFactory

### Test Environment Management
1. **Test Isolation**:
   - Tests affecting each other due to shared database state
   - Solution: Ensure proper cleanup between tests

2. **Performance Test Configuration**:
   - Performance tests may be too strict for test environments
   - Solution: Adjust performance thresholds for Docker testing

## 3. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Standardize test fixtures and factory formats
2. Fix customer factory string length issues
3. Implement transaction isolation for tests 
4. Add materialized view creation in test setup

### Medium-Term Actions
1. Create a shared test mixin for common setup/teardown
2. Implement a standard approach to mock database connections
3. Separate PostgreSQL-specific tests better

### Long-Term Improvements
1. Create a dedicated test settings file
2. Implement fixture factories for consistent test data
3. Add code coverage reporting to test runs

## 4. Test Run Times

Performance of test runs has been analyzed:
- Management command tests: ~5 seconds
- Model tests: ~10 seconds  
- Serializer tests: ~12 seconds
- View tests: ~15 seconds
- Integration tests: ~20 seconds
- Total test suite: ~70 seconds

## 5. Example Tests to Use as Reference

The following tests provide good patterns to follow:
- `test_refresh_commands.py`: Good example of mocking database connections
- `test_order_model.py`: Good pattern for unit testing models
- `test_view_relationship_with_order` in `test_ordersku_view.py`: Good example of mocking relationships
- `test_search_integration` in `test_order_lifecycle.py`: Good integration test pattern

## 6. Conclusion

The Orders app test suite is moving in the right direction with several passing tests, particularly for management commands and basic model operations. However, there are still significant issues to resolve with database integration, test isolation, and mock objects. By addressing these issues systematically, we can improve the test coverage and reliability.
