## Test Implementation Approach

### Unit Tests

We implemented unit tests using a custom factory pattern that works reliably with the database:

1. **Factory Setup**:
   - Created factories for Customer, Service, and CustomerService models
   - Each factory handles database schema creation if needed
   - Proper relationships and constraints are maintained

2. **Model Testing**:
   - Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Field validation including zero and negative values
   - Unique constraints and foreign key relationships
   - Edge cases like extremely large values

### Integration Tests

Our integration tests focus on cross-component functionality:

1. **Billing Integration**:
   - Testing creation of billing reports from customer services
   - Verifying proper calculation of totals
   - Handling of billing report details and metadata

2. **Service Type Queries**:
   - Testing queries across service types
   - Verifying relationships between customers and services
   - Calculating aggregates across services

### Contract Tests

Contract tests verify the API meets frontend expectations:

1. **Mock API Client**:
   - Created a mock API client that mimics the real API
   - Implements all standard REST endpoints
   - Properly handles serialization and responses

2. **Endpoint Testing**:
   - Verified all CRUD operations
   - Tested filtering and pagination
   - Ensured proper error responses

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Not yet implemented
   - Should test high-volume scenarios
   - Need to verify materialized view refresh performance

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Additional validation edge cases could be tested
   - More comprehensive error handling tests
   - Race condition testing for concurrent updates

3. **Coverage Gaps**:
   - Complex conditional branches in some methods
   - Exception handling paths
   - Permission edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Performance Tests**:
   - Create `test_performance.py`
   - Test high-volume operations
   - Measure query performance

2. **Enhance Contract Tests**:
   - Add more detailed validation testing
   - Test additional error states
   - Verify additional metadata fields

3. **Improve Overall Coverage**:
   - Target 95%+ line coverage
   - Target 90%+ branch coverage
   - Focus on identified coverage gaps
