## Critical Bug Fix: 'ne' Operator (March 2025)

**Status: Fixed and Verified**

### Issue
The "not equals" (`ne`) operator was incorrectly implemented in the `evaluate_condition` function in rules/views.py. The function was looking for 'neq' instead of 'ne', causing "not equals" conditions to incorrectly evaluate as false.

### Fix
Modified `evaluate_condition` to support both 'ne' and 'neq' for backward compatibility:

```python
# Before fix (incorrect)
elif operator == 'neq':  # ‚Üê BUG: using 'neq' instead of 'ne'
    return str(order_value) != str(value)

# After fix (correct)
elif operator == 'ne' or operator == 'neq':  # Support both 'ne' and 'neq'
    return str(order_value) != str(value)
```

### Verification
The fix has been verified using multiple test approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive tests for the `evaluate_condition` function
2. **Integration Tests**: Tested rule evaluation with models and API endpoints
3. **Standalone Tests**: Verified the fix using standalone test scripts
4. **Manual Testing**: Tested through the Rule Tester UI

All tests passed successfully, confirming that both 'ne' and 'neq' operators now work as expected.

### Documentation
Created/updated the following documentation:

- Updated [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with details of the fix
- Created [docs/RULE_OPERATORS.md](docs/RULE_OPERATORS.md) for operator documentation
- Created [docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md](docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md) for testing instructions
- Updated [README.md](README.md) with information about the critical bug fix
- Added test files for ongoing verification:
  - `rules/test_condition_evaluator.py`
  - `rules/test_rule_evaluation.py`
  - `rules/test_rule_tester.py`
  - `rules/test_integration.py`
  - `test_scripts/test_ne_standalone.py`

### Impact Assessment
This bug had the potential to affect:
- Billing calculations based on rules using the 'ne' operator
- Rule-based business logic decisions
- Service eligibility determinations

An audit of the database found no current rules using the 'ne' operator, so there is no immediate impact on existing data or calculations. Any new rules created using 'ne' will now work correctly.

### Future Prevention
1. Created comprehensive tests to prevent regression
2. Documented proper operator usage
3. Added testing plan in TODO.md for similar issues
4. Updated the testing infrastructure to make it easier to test rule evaluation
