1. **Authentication Tests** (`auth.cy.js`)
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Protected route access
   - Invalid credential handling

2. **Customer Management Tests** (`customers.cy.js`)
   - Customer listing and filtering
   - Customer creation with validation
   - Customer editing and deletion

3. **Order Management Tests** (`orders.cy.js`)
   - Order listing and filtering
   - Order creation with validation
   - Order status updates

4. **Product Management Tests** (`products.cy.js`)
   - Product listing
   - Product creation and validation
   - Product deletion

5. **Billing Tests** (`billing.cy.js`)
   - Billing report generation
   - Filtering by date range and customer
   - Report preview and verification

6. **Rules Management Tests** (`rules.cy.js`)
   - Rule group creation
   - Basic and advanced rule creation
   - Case-based tier configuration
   - Rule validation and testing

7. **Services Management Tests** (`services.cy.js`)
   - Service listing
   - Service creation and validation
   - Service editing and deletion

8. **Customer Services Management Tests** (`customer_services.cy.js`)
   - Customer service listing and filtering
   - Customer service creation with validation
   - Customer service editing and deletion
   - Associated rules display

9. **Accessibility Tests** (`a11y.cy.js`)
   - WCAG compliance checks for all major pages
   - Keyboard navigation testing

## Test Infrastructure

### Cypress Configuration

The Cypress configuration in `cypress.config.js` has been set up with:

- Base URL for the frontend application
- Environment variables for API endpoints
- Custom task for logging
- Video recording and screenshot capture
- Extended timeouts for slower operations

### Custom Commands

Custom Cypress commands have been implemented in `cypress/support/commands.js`:

- `login()`: Authenticates with the application
- `logout()`: Logs out from the application
- `createCustomer()`: Creates a test customer for dependent tests
- `cleanupTestData()`: Cleans up test data after tests
- `checkA11y()`: Runs accessibility checks with axe-core
- `logA11yViolations()`: Logs detailed accessibility violations

### Test Data Strategy

Tests use a combination of:

1. **Test fixtures**: Pre-loaded data from the backend via Django fixtures
2. **Dynamic test data**: Generated during test execution with unique timestamps
3. **API mocking**: For consistent responses in some test scenarios

## Test Pattern

Each test file follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Setup**: Login and API interception in `beforeEach`
2. **Navigation**: Verifying page navigation and URL changes
3. **UI Verification**: Checking for expected UI elements
4. **CRUD Operations**: Testing create, read, update, and delete operations
5. **Validation**: Ensuring form validation works correctly
6. **Error Handling**: Testing error conditions and messages

## Accessibility Testing

The `a11y.cy.js` file implements accessibility testing using cypress-axe:

- Tests key pages for WCAG 2.0 AA compliance
- Logs detailed information about accessibility violations
- Focuses on critical user flows

## Running the Tests

The following npm scripts have been added to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "cypress:open": "cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "cypress run",
    "test:e2e": "cypress run",
    "test:e2e:ci": "cypress run --headless"
  }
}
```

To run the tests:

```bash
# Open Cypress GUI
npm run cypress:open

# Run all e2e tests headlessly
npm run test:e2e

# Run a specific test
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/auth.cy.js"
```

## Testing Strategy and Best Practices

1. **Independence**: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on other tests
2. **Data Management**: Tests create and clean up their own data
3. **API Interception**: All API calls are intercepted for verification
4. **Selectors**: Using data-testid attributes for reliable selectors
5. **Wait Patterns**: Using proper wait strategies instead of arbitrary timeouts
6. **Debugging**: Clear logs and failure screenshots
7. **Maintainability**: Following consistent patterns across tests

## Continuous Integration

The end-to-end tests have been configured to run in the CI pipeline:

1. Backend and frontend servers are started in CI
2. Test fixtures are loaded
3. Cypress tests run in headless mode
4. Results and videos are stored as artifacts

## Future Improvements

1. **Cross-browser Testing**: Configure tests to run on multiple browsers
2. **Mobile Testing**: Add tests for responsive design and mobile views
3. **Performance Metrics**: Collect performance metrics during tests
4. **Visual Testing**: Add visual regression testing
5. **Expand Coverage**: Add more edge cases and complex user flows
