# Case-Based Tier Testing Results

## Overview
We've tested the case-based tier rule functionality in both the frontend and backend systems. This feature allows pricing tiers based on the number of cases in an order, with the ability to exclude specific SKUs from the count.

## Validation Tests
We've verified that validation works consistently between the frontend and backend by:
1. Creating parallel test cases in both systems
2. Ensuring error messages are consistent
3. Testing all edge cases in the validation flow

### Key Validations Tested:
- Valid tier configuration passes both frontend and backend validation
- Missing ranges array correctly rejected in both systems
- Invalid min/max relationship (min > max) properly detected
- Missing required fields in tier configuration properly detected
- Negative values properly rejected
- Invalid excluded_skus format properly rejected

## Rule Engine Tests
We've verified that the rule evaluation logic works correctly:
1. Basic case-based tier calculation works with the correct multiplier
2. Excluded SKUs are properly removed from case count calculations
3. When tiers are properly defined, the correct tier is selected based on case count
4. When case count is outside all defined tiers, no adjustment is applied

### Test Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: SKU1(2) + SKU2(3) cases = 5 total, SKU3(1) excluded
  - Expected: Tier 4-6 cases with 2.0 multiplier
  - Result: ✅ $100 base → $200 final price

- **Scenario 2**: SKU1(5) + SKU2(10) cases = 15 total
  - Expected: Tier 11-15 cases with 3.0 multiplier
  - Result: ✅ $100 base → $300 final price

- **Scenario 3**: SKU1(20) + SKU2(5) cases = 25 total (outside all defined tiers)
  - Expected: No matching tier, no adjustment
  - Result: ✅ $100 base → $100 final price (unchanged)

## Data Structure Consistency
We've verified that:
1. The frontend always submits tier_config at the root level of the rule data
2. Backend validation properly checks for tier_config at both the model level and calculation level
3. Case tier ranges and excluded_skus are stored and processed in a consistent format

## Integration Verification
The system properly integrates with:
1. The rules creation UI (AdvancedRuleBuilder component)
2. Backend validation and storage
3. Runtime rule evaluation for billing calculations

## Conclusions
The case-based tier functionality is working correctly in both frontend and backend systems. Validation is consistent, and rules are evaluated correctly based on the case counts in orders, with proper handling of excluded SKUs.
