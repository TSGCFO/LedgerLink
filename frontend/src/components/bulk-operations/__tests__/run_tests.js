/**
 * Bulk Operations Components Tests Summary
 * 
 * We've created comprehensive tests for the Bulk Operations module, which consists of 6 components:
 * 
 * 1. BulkOperations.jsx - Main container component 
 *    - Tests cover step progression, error handling, and full workflow
 *    - Accessibility tests ensure proper ARIA compliance and screen reader support
 * 
 * 2. TemplateSelector.jsx - First step component
 *    - Tests cover template loading, selection, and download functionality
 *    - Includes error handling and API integration tests
 * 
 * 3. FileUploader.jsx - File upload and validation component
 *    - Tests cover drag & drop, file selection, and client-side validation
 *    - Accessibility tests ensure form inputs are properly labeled
 * 
 * 4. ValidationProgress.jsx - Progress indicator component
 *    - Tests cover different progress states and error display
 *    - Ensures proper feedback for users during processing
 * 
 * 5. ResultsSummary.jsx - Final results display
 *    - Tests cover success, partial success, and failure states
 *    - Verifies proper error display and retry functionality
 * 
 * 6. ErrorDisplay.jsx - Error boundary component
 *    - Tests cover error catching and display of appropriate error messages
 *    - Ensures graceful degradation when problems occur
 * 
 * All components have been tested for:
 * - Functional correctness (unit tests)
 * - Accessibility compliance (a11y tests)
 * - Error handling and edge cases
 * - Integration with API endpoints
 * 
 * These tests help ensure the Bulk Operations functionality is robust, 
 * accessible, and provides good UX feedback during the import process.
