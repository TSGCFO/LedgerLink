# LedgerLink Frontend Testing Roadmap

## Test Coverage Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan to improve test coverage across the LedgerLink frontend application. It prioritizes actions based on coverage gaps and business impact.

## Current Test Coverage Matrix

| Module | Test File | # Tests | Coverage Level | Comments |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Authentication | auth.cy.js | 7 | Comprehensive | Core login/logout flows tested |
| Billing | billing.cy.js | 4 | Moderate | Basic functionality only |
| Bulk Operations | bulk_operations.cy.js | 6 | Comprehensive | Recently improved |
| Customer Services | customer_services.cy.js | 43 | Very Comprehensive | Excellent coverage |
| Customers | customers.cy.js | 29 | Very Comprehensive | All CRUD operations covered |
| Orders | orders.cy.js | 16 | Comprehensive | Missing complex scenarios |
| Products | products.cy.js | 23 | Comprehensive | Good coverage |
| Rules | rules.cy.js | 48 | Very Comprehensive | Complex rules well tested |
| Services | services.cy.js | 22 | Comprehensive | Good coverage |
| Accessibility | a11y.cy.js | 6 | Basic | Simple navigation tests only |
| **Missing Tests** | | | | |
| Inserts | - | 0 | None | No tests implemented |
| Materials | - | 0 | None | No tests implemented |
| Shipping | - | 0 | None | No tests implemented |

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Create Missing E2E Tests (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Inserts Module Tests
- [ ] Create `inserts.cy.js` file with basic structure
- [ ] Implement tests for insert listing page
- [ ] Implement tests for insert creation
- [ ] Implement tests for insert editing
- [ ] Implement tests for insert deletion
- [ ] Implement tests for insert validation
- [ ] Implement tests for error handling

#### 1.2 Materials Module Tests
- [ ] Create `materials.cy.js` file with basic structure
- [ ] Implement tests for materials listing page
- [ ] Implement tests for material creation
- [ ] Implement tests for material editing
- [ ] Implement tests for material deletion
- [ ] Implement tests for validation
- [ ] Implement tests for box price management

#### 1.3 Shipping Module Tests
- [ ] Create `shipping.cy.js` file with basic structure
- [ ] Implement tests for US shipping listing
- [ ] Implement tests for CAD shipping listing
- [ ] Implement tests for shipping record creation
- [ ] Implement tests for shipping record editing
- [ ] Implement tests for shipping validation
- [ ] Implement tests for shipping rate calculations

### 2. Enhance Existing Test Coverage (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Billing Module Improvements
- [ ] Add tests for error handling in report generation
- [ ] Add tests for report download functionality
- [ ] Add tests for different pricing scenarios (tiered, flat rate)
- [ ] Add tests for billing data validation
- [ ] Add tests for exporting reports in different formats

#### 2.2 Auth Module Improvements
- [ ] Add tests for password reset flow
- [ ] Add tests for session timeout handling
- [ ] Add tests for invalid token scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for access level restrictions

#### 2.3 Orders Module Improvements
- [ ] Add tests for partial fulfillment scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for order modifications
- [ ] Add tests for complex order filtering
- [ ] Add tests for order status transitions

### 3. Accessibility Testing Improvements (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create proper accessibility test configuration
- [ ] Implement true accessibility testing for main pages
- [ ] Create accessibility tests for form components
- [ ] Create accessibility tests for navigation components
- [ ] Create accessibility tests for table components
- [ ] Document known accessibility exceptions

### 4. Test Resilience Improvements (Ongoing)

- [ ] Add data-cy attributes to all components for better targeting
- [ ] Refactor tests to use more robust selectors
- [ ] Enhance error handling in test callbacks
- [ ] Implement better waiting strategies for async operations
- [ ] Create helpers for common test operations

### 5. Performance Optimization (Low Priority)

- [ ] Review and reduce unnecessary waits
- [ ] Group related tests to minimize setup/teardown
- [ ] Implement test parallelization where possible
- [ ] Optimize test data creation and cleanup

## Timeline

* **Sprint 1**: Focus on tasks 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 (Missing E2E Tests)
* **Sprint 2**: Focus on tasks 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 (Enhance Existing Coverage)
* **Sprint 3**: Focus on task 3 (Accessibility Testing) and begin task 4 (Test Resilience)
* **Ongoing**: Continue with task 4 and 5 as regular maintenance work

## Success Metrics

* **Code Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all components
* **Test Reliability**: <5% flaky tests in CI pipeline
* **Build Time**: Keep test execution under 10 minutes in CI
* **Bug Detection**: >90% of regression bugs caught by tests before release
