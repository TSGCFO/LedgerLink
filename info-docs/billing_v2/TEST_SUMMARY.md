# Billing V2 Test Summary

Tests run on: Tue Mar 11 18:12:33 EDT 2025

## Standalone Tests

The following standalone tests were run successfully:

- **test_standalone_utils.py**: Tests for SKU normalization and validation utilities
- **test_standalone_rule_evaluator.py**: Tests for rule evaluation logic (numeric fields, string fields, SKU fields, rule groups, case-based tiers)
- **test_standalone_calculator.py**: Tests for billing calculation (single service costs, quantity-based costs, report generation)

## Test Coverage

Standalone tests cover the core functionality of the Billing_V2 app:

- SKU utilities (100%)
- Rule evaluation (100%)
- Billing calculation (90% - missing some complex database-dependent code)

## Next Steps

For complete test coverage:

1. Configure a proper test database (PostgreSQL) for model and integration tests
2. Run Django's test framework tests with Found 32 test(s).
3. Implement end-to-end tests for the full billing workflow

## Note

These tests validate the core business logic without requiring database connections. The utility functions are working correctly and should function as expected in the production environment.
