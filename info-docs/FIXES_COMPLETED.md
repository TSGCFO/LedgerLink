# Fixes Completed

## Database Schema and Test Environment Improvements

We've successfully resolved the testing issues caused by database schema mismatches. The specific improvements include:

### 1. Fixed Migration Application

- Modified conftest.py to properly apply migrations rather than directly creating tables
- Ensured consistent database schema across all testing environments
- Added proper handling for TestContainers and Docker test environments

### 2. Added Schema Verification Utilities

- Created comprehensive schema verification utilities in `tests/utils/schema_verification.py`
- Implemented functions to check specific fields, entire models, and critical models
- Added clear diagnostic messages for schema issues

### 3. Enhanced Test Scripts

- Updated `run_orders_tests.sh` to include schema verification
- Made test scripts more robust with fallback options
- Added explicit schema checks to ensure critical fields exist

### 4. Documentation

- Created detailed documentation in `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_TESTING.md`
- Provided examples and best practices for managing migrations and schema
- Added troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### 5. Test-Specific Improvements

- Added order-specific test configuration in `orders/tests/conftest.py`
- Created proper fixtures for order tests
- Implemented app-specific schema verification

## Verified Fixes

We've verified that:

1. The `is_active` field in the Customer model exists in the database schema
2. The minimal tests for orders app run successfully
3. The schema verification utilities correctly identify any schema issues
4. The test environment can be properly initialized with migrations

## Future Work

While we've fixed the immediate issues, there are some areas for future improvement:

1. Add CI steps for schema verification
2. Create a pre-commit hook to verify models and migrations
3. Add more comprehensive testing for other apps
4. Consider automating the creation of missing migrations

These improvements will further strengthen the testing infrastructure and prevent similar issues in the future.
