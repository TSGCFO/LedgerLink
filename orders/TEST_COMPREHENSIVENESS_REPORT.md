## Test Structure

The testing suite for the Orders app follows the comprehensive testing approach implemented for other apps, with special focus on the materialized view functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Model tests (field validation, constraints, serialization)
   - Serializer tests (validation, SKU quantity handling, status transitions)
   - Management command tests (materialized view refresh)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - View tests (API endpoints, filtering, searching)
   - Order lifecycle tests (status transitions, business rules)
   - Product integration tests (SKU handling, product references)

3. **Contract Tests**:
   - PACT provider tests for frontend-backend contract verification
   - Provider states for different order statuses and scenarios

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Query performance tests
   - Materialized view performance 
   - Bulk operations and concurrent access

## Test Implementation Details

### Unit Tests

- **Models**: Tests for Order model fields, constraints, and methods
- **Materialized View**: Tests for OrderSKUView functionality
- **Serializers**: Tests for validation, especially SKU quantity and status transitions
- **Management Commands**: Tests for refreshing materialized views

### Integration Tests

- **Views**: Tests for all API endpoints, filtering, searching
- **Order Lifecycle**: Tests for order status transitions and business rules
- **Product Integration**: Tests for SKU references and product changes

### Contract Tests

- Tests for all API endpoints with PACT provider verification
- Provider states for different order scenarios
- Frontend-backend contract validation

### Performance Tests

- Tests for query performance with different filters
- Tests for materialized view efficiency
- Tests for bulk operations and concurrent access

## Key Test Scenarios

1. **Order Lifecycle**:
   - Creating orders with valid data
   - Status transitions (draft → submitted → shipped → delivered)
   - Order cancellation at different stages
   - Validation for each status transition

2. **SKU Handling**:
   - Validation of SKU quantity format
   - Calculation of total item quantities
   - Integration with products via SKUs
   - Case and pick calculations

3. **Materialized View Performance**:
   - Efficiency of the OrderSKUView
   - Refresh performance
   - Query optimization
   - Aggregation performance

4. **API Functionality**:
   - CRUD operations
   - Filtering by customer, status, priority
   - Searching by reference number, customer name
   - Status counts and statistics

## Areas for Further Improvement

1. **Schema Validation Testing**: Add more tests for JSON schema validation of the SKU quantity field
2. **Edge Cases**: Additional tests for rare edge cases and error conditions
3. **Load Testing**: More comprehensive load testing with larger datasets

## Issues Addressed

1. Added contract tests with PACT provider verification
2. Enhanced performance tests for materialized view
3. Added product integration tests
4. Improved test coverage for order lifecycle edge cases
5. Fixed materialized view testing with proper database setup
6. Resolved cascade delete issues with proper database structure
7. Fixed transaction_id generation to work within database limits
8. Improved test isolation and setup/teardown procedures

## Implementation Challenges Overcome

### Database Schema Alignment
- Fixed missing tables like `billing_billingreportdetail` and schema-aligned `generated_at` column
- Created `shipping_cadshipping` and `shipping_usshipping` tables to support cascade delete testing
- Properly set up materialized view `orders_sku_view` with all required columns and indexes

### Import Path Issues
- Corrected import paths for the mock_ordersku_view module
- Fixed skipif conditions to properly handle materialized view tests

### Materialized Views Setup
- Created SQL scripts to properly set up materialized views
- Added proper indexes to support efficient querying
- Implemented refresh mechanisms for materialized views
- Added CASCADE to materialized view drops to avoid dependency issues

### Test Stability
- Changed transaction_id generation to use smaller integers (within PostgreSQL INT limits)
- Modified cascade delete tests to avoid complex materialized view dependencies
- Added comprehensive structure verification in the test setup script

### Script Enhancements
- Added pre-test database verification to check schema alignment
- Added error handling for common test failures
- Improved test isolation with proper cleanup between test runs

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing comprehensive tests for related apps
2. Create end-to-end tests that cover workflows spanning multiple apps
3. Integrate performance benchmarks into CI/CD pipeline
4. Apply the database schema verification approach to all app test scripts
