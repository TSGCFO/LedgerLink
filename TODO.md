# TODO: Testing Improvements and Django Testing Infrastructure

## Completed Tasks

✅ **Create standalone test scripts**
   - Implemented scripts that run outside Django to test the operator evaluation
   - Created mock objects to simulate order data
   - Added comprehensive test cases for `ne` and `neq` operators
   - Added logging to capture test results

✅ **Create integration tests for rules evaluation**
   - Created tests to verify rule evaluation with real models
   - Tested basic rules with `ne` and `neq` operators
   - Tested rules with `ncontains` and `not_contains` operators
   - Tested rule groups with mixed operators and logic operators (AND, OR, NOT)

✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite Development**
   - Created unit tests for all operators (`eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, etc.)
   - Added tests with different data types (strings, numbers, empty values, None)
   - Added tests for edge cases in case-based tier calculations
   - Added tests for SKU normalization and proper handling of SKU formats

✅ **Billing System Testing**
   - Created comprehensive tests for the billing calculator
   - Added tests for case-based tier pricing
   - Tested integration between rules and billing
   - Added tests for SKU-based billing calculations

## Remaining Tasks

### Django Testing Infrastructure Fixes

1. **Fix database configuration for tests**
   - Modify `settings.py` to use in-memory SQLite for tests
   ```python
   if 'test' in sys.argv:
       DATABASES = {
           'default': {
               'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
               'NAME': ':memory:',
           }
       }
   ```

2. **Add test settings module**
   - Create `test_settings.py` file
   - Configure test-specific settings
   - Add environment variable handling for test mode

3. **Fix test database conflicts**
   - Add proper teardown for test databases
   - Fix materialized view issues in test environment
   - Add cleanup scripts for test databases

4. **Configure non-interactive test execution**
   - Modify test runner to avoid input prompts
   - Add `--noinput` flag support to custom commands
   - Create pytest configuration for automated testing

### Additional Testing

1. **Manual Testing via Rule Tester UI**
   - Test the "not equals" operator through the frontend Rule Tester
   - Test the "not contains" operator through the frontend Rule Tester
   - Verify correct evaluation results

2. **Test the rule tester API endpoint**
   - Create API tests for the `/test-rule/` endpoint
   - Test with various rule configurations 
   - Verify correct response format and evaluation results

## Documentation Updates

1. **Update operator documentation**
   - Document proper usage of `ne` vs `neq` operators
   - Document proper usage of `ncontains` vs `not_contains` operators
   - Add examples of correct condition syntax
   - Update API documentation for rule testing

2. **Create testing guide**
   - Document how to run the standalone tests
   - Document how to run the Django-integrated tests
   - Include troubleshooting steps for test database issues
   - Document test environment setup

## Test Performance and Reliability

1. **Add test transaction management**
   - Ensure tests use transactions for isolation
   - Add proper cleanup between test cases

2. **Implement CI/CD test configuration**
   - Configure automated testing in CI pipeline
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Set up notifications for test failures

## Billing Impact Analysis

1. **✅ Audit existing rules using `ne` operator**
   - Identified all rules in production using this operator
   - Verified correct evaluation with fixed code
   - Documented discrepancies

2. **Create billing recalculation plan**
   - Identify affected billing reports
   - Develop strategy for recalculation if needed
   - Create validation scripts to verify accuracy

## Security and Performance Testing

1. **Add security tests for rule evaluation**
   - Test input validation for rule conditions
   - Verify proper sanitization of user inputs
   - Test permission controls for rule testing

2. **Add performance tests**
   - Benchmark rule evaluation performance
   - Test with large sets of rules and conditions
   - Optimize evaluation engine if needed
