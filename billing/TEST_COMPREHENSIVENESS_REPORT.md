   - More complex rule combinations
   - Additional field types
   - Edge cases in rule evaluation

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Large report generation
   - Caching performance
   - Database query optimization

3. **Concurrency Testing**:
   - Simultaneous report generation
   - Cache conflicts
   - Parallel database operations

4. **Export Formats**:
   - PDF export testing
   - Excel formatting
   - CSV field encoding

5. **Security Testing**:
   - Permission verification
   - Input sanitization
   - Access control

## Recommendations

To further improve the test suite:

1. Add more complex integration tests that simulate real-world billing scenarios
2. Expand unit tests for export formats (PDF, Excel)
3. Add performance benchmarks for large data sets
4. Implement permutation testing for all rule operator combinations
5. Add visual verification for report formats
6. Add contract tests to ensure consistency between frontend expectations and API responses

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Expand rule evaluator tests to cover all operators
   - Add more integration tests for specific customer scenarios
   - Improve error path testing in views

2. **Medium-term (2-4 weeks)**:
   - Implement export format verification tests
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement cross-app workflow tests

3. **Long-term (1-2 months)**:
   - Implement comprehensive security testing
   - Add visual testing for reports
   - Create automated regression test suite

## Conclusion

The billing app test suite provides solid coverage of core functionality with comprehensive testing of models, services, and key business logic. The established test structure allows for easy expansion to cover additional scenarios and edge cases. With the implementation of the recommended improvements, the test suite will provide excellent coverage and reliability for the billing system.
